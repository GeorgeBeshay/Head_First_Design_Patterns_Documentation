## Design Principles
- Depend upon abstractions, do not depend upon concrete classes.

## Fourth & Fifth Design Patterns
- **The Factory Method Design Pattern:** Provides an interface for creating an object, but lets 
subclasses decide which class to instantiate. Factory Method
lets a class defer (delegates) instantiation to subclasses
- **The Abstract Factory Design Pattern:** Provides an interface for creating a families 
of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
