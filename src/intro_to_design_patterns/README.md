## Design Principles:
- Identify the aspect of the application which varies,
and separate them from which does not.
- Program to an interface not to an implementation. (IF / Abstract Class)
- Favor composition over inheritance. (Has A Relationship > Is A Relationship).

## First Design Pattern
- **The Strategy Design Pattern:** Defines a family of algorithms and encapsulates each one - family -
and makes them interchangeable, Strategy lets the algorithms varies independently from the clients
that use it.
