# <p align="center"> Notes </p>
***

- A `Pattern` is a solution to a problem in a context.
  - Where the context is the situation in which the pattern applies, and this should be a
  recurring situation (such as having a collection of objects.)
  - The problem refers to the goal you are trying to achieve or a set of constraints to be applied in this context (such as stepping through those objects
  without exposing their implementation.)
  - The solution is the general design anyone can apply to resolve the goal and any set of constraints. (encapsulate the iteration into a separate class.)
- Patterns are classified grouped by one of the following:
  - Creational, Structural, Behavioral Patterns.
  - Deals with **objects** or **classes**
- Thinking in patterns
  - Keep it simple: your goal should be simplicity not "how can i apply a pattern to this problem."
  - Refactoring time is patterns time
  - Don't be afraid to remove a design pattern from your design.
  - If you don't need it now, don't do it now
  - Beginner Mind: uses pattern every where, more patterns better design ..
  - Intermediate Mind: starts recognizing situations where a pattern may fit it.
  - Zen Mind: Recognizes patterns that would fit naturally in this situation, he thinks in terms of OO principles.
- Shoot for practical extensibility. don't provide hypothetical generality. be extensible in ways that matter.
- Go for simplicity and don't become overexcited on using a pattern.
- Patterns are tools not rules, they need to be tweaked and adapted to your problem.
- An `Anti-Pattern` tells you how to go from a problem to a bad solution.
  - An anti pattern always looks like a good solution, but then turns out to be a bad solution when it is applied,
  so by documenting them we help others recognize bad solutions before they implement them and waste their time on.
